// 1. Write a ~1 sentence summary for each one


// a. DRY

//  The one of the single most important concepts in programming. DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF, this 
// highlights the importance of using the tools available to us to ensure we are as efficient
//  and concise as possible. Basically, do *not* Waste Everyone's Time.

// b. KISS // Keep It Simple, Stupid

// Make sure code is super simple as that will ensure your code is very readable, additionally,
// that your code is less prone to bugs.


// c. Avoid creating a YAGNI

// You can avoid this by only adding functionality when you need it and not anticipating it incase 
//  you don't

// d. Do the simplest thing that could possibly work

//  This concept puts us in the mind frame to brainstorm in the simplest way possible. This ensures
//  the path toward simplicity in design.

// e. Don't make me think

// This concept pushes the notion where we should make code that is readable with minimal effort
// and time.

// f. Write code for the maintainer

// Writing for the maintainer means be clear and descriptive. Write so that whoever is reading your
// your code can understand what is going on...sometimes that person is you.

// g. Single responsibility principle

// This principle tells us to ensure that each class or module should have a clear and robust 
// responsibility and that its preforms a well deined class

// h. Avoid premature optimization

// Do NOT think about optimizing your code until you have code that works. When you get to the 
// point where you have clear code thats running, it is then appropriate to start think about 
// how it can be more efficient.

// i. Separation of concerns

// This means that we should categorize our blocks of code that overlapping occurs less and such
// that the are distinctly in different sections.



// 2. Which ones surprise you (if any)?

// The principles make a lot of sense to me, they definitely set the programmer up so that from
// the very beggining they are thinking to themselves how can I be simple so that they have to do 
// less when their code is written.


// 3. Which one is currently giving you the most struggle?

// Although the concepts are super simple to understand, the application of DRY and KISS are giving
// me a bit of a hard time. I need to spend more time breaking big problems down in to small steps
// and not overthinking myself in to doing something complication. *exhales praacticeee*


// 4. Commenting Code

// a. In keeping with one of our programming principals (write code for the maintainer): What would 
// have been a more semantic name for this function (hint: this is a problem we had for either lab 
// or hw and is considered a classic ) - are there any other variable names or things that would make
//  this code easier to read and understand?

// ?????????ones that are more semantic??


// b. If you started a new job and your project was to expand the functionality of this function by 
// allowing a second argument and then based on that second argument, returning the sum of even 
// or odd numbers, which code would you rather start working with f or f2?

// Definitelty f2 because it is more semantic and I wouldn't have to look at the values of the variables
// as much.

// c. Finally, the 'shorter' code style doesn't use semi-colons, except for the fourth line. Remove 
// this semi-colon! Run the code, is this semi-colon necessary?

// Clearly the Semi colon is not necessary because the code ran the same.

// 1. Create an object, called crayonBox, that has a property that is an array. 
// The array should have the names of some crayons. Log one of the elements of that array.

crayonBox = {
    ["midnight blue", "sunset orange", "field green"]
}

console.log(crayonBox[1])
